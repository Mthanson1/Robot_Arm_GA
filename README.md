Genetic algorithm program for minimizing the amount of torque generated about the origin while still meeting positional requirements.

The genetic algorithm mimics natural selection as it approches the lowest 'cost' design.

All linkage density's are accounted for in the general torque equation and this algorithm is designed to optimize the 'T' parameter as outlined in the project description.
